SI-HDR - dataset for comparison of single-image high dynamic range reconstruction methods
2022 August

The dataset consists of 181 HDR images. Each image includes:
* a RAW exposure stack (in raw.zip)
* an HDR image (in reference.zip)
* simulated camera images at two different exposures (in input.zip)
* Results of 6 single-image HDR reconstruction methods: Endo et al. 2017, Eilertsen et al. 2017, Marnerides et al. 2018, Lee et al. 2018, Liu et al. 2020, and Santos et al. 2020 (in reconstructions.zip)

# Overview

This dataset contains 181 RAW exposure stacks selected to cover a wide range of image content and lighting conditions. Each scene is composed of 5 RAW exposures and merged into an HDR image using the estimator that accounts photon noise [3] (code at [HDRutils](https://github.com/gfxdisp/HDRutils)). A simple color correction was applied using a reference white point and all merged HDR images were resized to 1920×1280 pixels.

The primary purpose of the dataset was to compare various single image HDR (SI-HDR) methods [1]. Thus, we selected a wide variety of content covering nature, portraits, cities, indoor and outdoor, daylight and night scenes. After merging and resizing, we simulated captures by applying a custom CRF and added realistic camera noise based on estimated noise parameters of *Canon 5D Mark III*.

The simulated captures were inputs to six selected SI-HDR methods. You can view the reconstructions of various methods for select scenes on our [interactive viewer](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/sihdr_benchmark/). For the remaining scenes, please download the appropriate zip files. We conducted a rigorous pairwise comparison experiment on these images to find that widely-used metrics did not correlate well with subjective data. We then proposed an improved evaluation protocol for SI-HDR [1].

# Structure

The dataset consists of 4 folders, each available as a separate ZIP file. Here you can check which portion of the dataset you may want to download. 

The dataset is structured as follows:
```
	sihdr/
	|	raw/					# RAW 14 bit files
	|	|	001/
	|	|	|	\_07A5797.CR2
	|	|	|	\_07A5798.CR2
	|	|	|	...
	|	|
	|	├───002/
	|	├───003/
	|	|	...
	|
	├───reference/				# Merged and resized reference HDR
	|	|	001.exr
	|	|	002.exr
	|	|	...
	|
	├───input/					# SDR image after applying CRF, noise and quantization
	|	|	clip_95/
	|	|	|	001.png
	|	|	|	002.png
	|	|	|	...
	|	|
	|	└───clip_97/
	|		|	001.png
	|		|	002.png
	|		|	...
	|
	└───reconstructions/		# HDR outputs of various methods
		|	drtmo/
		|	expandnet/
		|	hdrcnn/
		|	hdrgan/
		|	maskhdr/
		└───singlehdr/
	
```

Note that the input contains two exposures or clipping levels (95% and 97%) corresponding to what percent of HDR pixels are retained during simulation. Thus each folder under "reconstructions" also has separate outputs for these two clipping levels.
